As of 2025, I have three years of experience in hardware electronics design and a year in software engineering.
I enjoy discovering, learning, and understanding new technologies to find interesting ways of using them.

I usually find areas of technology that I have not been exposed to and try to understand their fundamentals through practice, or creating a project to complete.
A good showcase of what I am currently thinking about would be on the [Projects](/Projects) tab.

I also enjoy puzzles and games as a way of challenging my creativity and lateral thinking.
A recent favourite is variant sudoku ([killer](http://sudopedia.enjoysudoku.com/Killer.html), [thermo](https://masteringsudoku.com/thermo-sudoku/), and [GAS](https://missingdeck.net/gas-collection-1) - daily random approachable puzzles.)
I'd also try a cryptic crossword once in a while if there's a newspaper around.
As for games, recent interesting ones were [Tunic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/), [Chants of Sennaar](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931770/Chants_of_Sennaar/), and [Outer Wilds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/).
