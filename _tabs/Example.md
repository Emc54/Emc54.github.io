                The Data Protection Solutions sector of Entrust in Cambridge, focuses on Hardware security modules (HSMs). 
                They are hardened, tamper-resistant hardware devices that secure cryptographic processes by generating, protecting, and managing keys used for encrypting and decrypting data and creating digital signatures and certificates.

My current position as an Electrical Engineer II, which amounts to the tasks of a hardware design
engineer within the company.
* Designed a PCB, tested, and have written the firmware for a [RP2040-based](https://thepihut.com/products/tiny-2040) power
monitoring interposer on a PCIe interface. 
  * Used in development for data collection.
  * Will be used in production to automate the detection of software updates that increase the power
draw of our hardware, thus improving unit reliability.
* Developed two iterations of a controller module for a
1U rack server using ARM Cortex M microcontrollers. 
  * Used to extent the lifetime of an existing product to include around 3000 more units.
* Currently tackling the development of future products alongside the 5-person hardware team,
mainly the upgrade to the 1U server appliance: 
  * Developed PCBs for the overall chassis,
  * Designed testing to improve performance, with a focus on cooling experiments. 
    * Data gathered through the cooling experiments has lead to 33% decrease in temperature with the same power usage.
* For 3 months (Jun â€“ Aug 2023), I moved across the organisation to take the role of a software
engineer. 
  * I set up the infrastructure, compilation, and linking environment for the
Cortex M microcontrollers in the controller module.
  * Developed the prototype firmware for the
microcontrollers, allowing validation of the design. This confirmed that I could safely start work on
the second iteration without major blockers or critical design changes.

               Crystal Vision made infrastructure and keying products for professional broadcast engineers in the television industry. It helped people transition through a range of technologies, from SD to HD and from HD to IP. Part of their products included FPGA transceivers for high-speed parallel video streaming solutions.

A two-month internship that involved hands-on experience with custom FPGA transceivers reaching
capabilities of 400Gb/s.
* Tested three different FPGA chips by designing testing software in VHDL to produce eye-
diagrams. 
* Wrote software for optimisation of their low-level VHDL routines.

This work performed manufacturing error checks while pushing the limitations of custom FPGA boards
both in maximum capabilities and reliability of continuous operation.
