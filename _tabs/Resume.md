## Work Experience

### Electrical Engineer II at [ENTRUST Corp. DPS](https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/hsm), Cambridge, UK
<hr>
_September 2021 - Present_

My current position as an Electrical Engineer II, which amounts to the tasks of a hardware design
engineer within the company, with additional software duties when they arise.

* **Designed** a PCB, tested, and wrote the firmware for an [RP2040-based](https://thepihut.com/products/tiny-2040) power
monitoring interposer on a PCIe interface.
* **Developed** two iterations of a controller module for a
[1U rack server](https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/hsm/products/nshield-hsms/nshield-connect) using ARM Cortex M microcontrollers.
* **Currently tackling** the development of future products alongside the 5-person hardware team,
mainly the next generation of the 1U server appliance.
* **Automating** the capabilities of the lab through python scripts, MQTT, and InfluxDB. 

##### For 3 months (Jun – Aug 2023), I moved across the organisation to take the role of a software engineer.

  * **Set up** the infrastructure, compilation, and linking environment for the
Cortex M microcontrollers in the controller module.
  * **Developed** the prototype firmware for the
microcontrollers, allowing validation of the design. This confirmed that I could safely start work on
the second iteration without major blockers or critical design changes.

### FPGA Software Engineer at [Crystal Vision Ltd.](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/crystal-vision-limited), Whittlesford, UK

<hr>
_July 2020 - August 2020_
{:.h6}

A two-month internship that involved hands-on experience with custom FPGA transceivers reaching
capabilities of 400Gb/s.

* Tested three different FPGA chips by designing software in VHDL to produce eye-
diagrams.
* Implemented algorithms for optimisation of their low-level VHDL routines.

This work performed manufacturing error checks while pushing the limitations of custom FPGA boards
both in maximum capabilities and reliability of continuous operation. ([More Information]({% link _extras/CrystalVision.md %}))

### FPGA Software Engineer at [Swindon Silicon Systems](https://www.swindonsilicon.com/custom-ic-design/), Swindon, UK

<hr>
_July 2019 - August 2019_
{:.h6}


A two-month internship at the company, in which I was part of a project involving the development of a
custom ASIC solution for a pressure-controlled haptic feedback device.
I used Vivado to program an FPGA to interface with Python via a Jupiter Notebook, to incorporate
simulation tests previously running on a PC to increase the portability of the overall design. ([More Information]({% link _extras/Swindon.md %}))

## Education

### Gonville & Caius College, University of Cambridge

_2017 - 2021_
{:.h6}
**MEng Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2.i, Cambridge MA**

* Sensors and Instrumentation
* Embedded Systems for the Internet of Things
* Radio Frequency and Integrated Digital Electronics
* Data Transmission
* Information Theory and Coding
* Computer Systems
* Software Engineering and Design
* Accounting, Finance, and Modelling Risk

#### [Master’s Thesis](https://github.com/Emc54/CoherentTransceivers)

Optical digital coherent transceivers have the capability of achieving 1 Tbit/s links in the core networks
and 100 Gbit/s links in an access network. I developed algorithms in MATLAB for the simulation of transceivers,
mainly those required for synchronisation and equalisation (both linear and nonlinear), as well as
modulation techniques such as probabilistic shaping.
