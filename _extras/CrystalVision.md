## What I learned

* I had the chance to work on high-speed signal analysis software, which helped me train in quickly developing skills with new unfamiliar technologies.

* I got the chance to develop a solution to completion, and then when asked to improve it, present a second iteration of the solution with the requested updates.

* It was a much smaller company with fewer resources, so I had to be able to adapt to the workload and types of work, that would usually rapidly change depending on the needs of the organisation.

* A lot of remote work was involved, especially because it was during the pandemic.
I had to deliver results without having the cushion of a senior engineer to fall back on, as opposed to my previous internship.

* My internship work here guided me to high-speed digital communications electives and choosing my master's project to high-speed digital signal transmission in optical fibre.
