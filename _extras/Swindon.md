## An overview of my proposed solution

The company had a lot of unit tests for VHDL in Vivado that was running on an FPGA.
The tests were issued on a Linux PC with the FPGA plugged in through the PCIe connector.
As they wanted to transition to tests more applicable to their use cases, portability became key.

The task at hand was to use a custom distro of Linux on an MCU to run the VHDL Tests.
The proposed interface between the user and the VHDL tests was Jupyter Notebooks.
