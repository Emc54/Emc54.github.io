## Motivation

The first instruction I was given on how to build a website by my Computer Science teacher when I was young, was to open a Word (2003) document.

I was made to write basic HTML with ```<head>``` and ```<body>``` information in said document, and save it as a .html file.
As you can imagine, I hated the whole idea.
It looked jarring and it felt like a ton of work to stylise any given element on the page.
I couldn't fathom that this was how websites were built.
Thankfully they aren't, but it did manage to dissuade me from trying to learn again for a long while.

Eventually, I did want to learn how interesting effects were made, and after a quick internet search, I started looking into CSS.
I wanted to stay away from javascript for two reasons: To see how far I could get with CSS alone, and to rest assured that I wouldn't have to worry about loading scripts and the overhead they might add to the page.

## Approaching CSS

The advice I followed in choosing projects was _"Find an element you like, and try to recreate it"._
Having no real guidelines on methodology for CSS, I decided to try and replicate elements with known implementations in [code.pen](code.pen).
In this way, I could work towards an end-goal, and get hints if I needed them.
Choosing a variety of projects would expose me to different approaches to CSS as well.
So to push my learning, I had also decided to make a meaningful modification to a project, once I've implemented it in its entirety.
This would help me confirm that I've consolidated the knowledge I've learned during the project.
