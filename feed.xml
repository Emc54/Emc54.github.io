      Motivation

I recently wanted to explore how neural networks operate, and set up
some of the models myself.
I found a great course and guidance from my peers to get started but was not
comfortable with how I could get the work done.
My laptop could be used easily and be brought into the AI office space, but was
lacking a dedicated GPU.
My PC has everything it would need to run the models with e...

      or at least writing them down.

Preamble

Over the last month I’ve invested my time in improving various often-neglected
skills.
I was considering two different avenues:

  How my relationships impact my day-to-day effectiveness.
  Balancing tasks has become more difficult with increased responsibility.


The next couple of posts are a summary of interesting resources I’ve adapted 
to help cope...

      The drive for a change
Going into university, I got a new laptop to assist me with my studies.
This was 7+ years ago now, and even the mid-life hardware updates I had performed to give it a new life and make it feel fresh again were not cutting it.
So after freshly installing Windows on it did not improve its start time, I was once again looking for a new machine after so long.

      Desire to Code

I wouldn’t claim to have taken a formal programming course and yet I feel confident in being able to come up with programmatic solutions to problems when necessary.
This has always felt hacky, and without much direction, I haven’t felt that I could escape this feeling.
I’ve considered two ways to address this desire to improve my programming skills.

      Beginning the project

I’ve understood how websites work on the surface level since I was a teenager.
At various times, I’ve started HTML documents and got them to display on a browser — simple text and images.
But it still annoyed me that I couldn’t see how you’d jump from that to a shop page with reactive windows and custom animations.
So after thinking about this from time to time, I finally...
