      Beginning the project

I’ve understood how websites work on the surface level since I was a teenager.
At various times, I’ve started HTML documents and got them to display on a browser — simple text and images.
But it still annoyed me that I couldn’t see how you’d jump from that to a shop page with reactive windows and custom animations.
So after thinking about this from time to time, I finally...

      Motivation

The first instruction I was given on how to build a website by my Computer Science teacher when I was young, was to open a Word (2003) document.

I was made to write basic HTML with &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; information in said document, and save it as a .html file.
As you can imagine, I hated the whole idea.
It looked jarring and it felt like a ton of work to stylise any given ...

      Adventures in CTF activities

Once in a while, I want a riddle or a puzzle to solve.
Capture-the-flag challenges are always able to scratch this itch.
So I’ll spend an afternoon going through an interesting challenge page that I found.
Here are some examples:
