Preamble

Over the last month I’ve invested my time in improving various often-neglected
skills.
I was considering two different avenues:

  How my relationships impact my day-to-day effectiveness.
  Balancing tasks has become more difficult with increased responsibility.


The next couple of posts are a summary of interesting resources I’ve adapted 
to help cope...

      The drive for a change
Going into university, I got a new laptop to assist me with my studies.
This was 7+ years ago now, and even the mid-life hardware updates I had performed to give it a new life and make it feel fresh again were not cutting it.
So after freshly installing Windows on it did not improve its start time, I was once again looking for a new machine after so long.

      Desire to Code

I wouldn’t claim to have taken a formal programming course and yet I feel confident in being able to come up with programmatic solutions to problems when necessary.
This has always felt hacky, and without much direction, I haven’t felt that I could escape this feeling.
I’ve considered two ways to address this desire to improve my programming skills.

      Beginning the project

I’ve understood how websites work on the surface level since I was a teenager.
At various times, I’ve started HTML documents and got them to display on a browser — simple text and images.
But it still annoyed me that I couldn’t see how you’d jump from that to a shop page with reactive windows and custom animations.
So after thinking about this from time to time, I finally...

      Motivation

The first instruction I was given on how to build a website by my Computer Science teacher when I was young, was to open a Word (2003) document.

I was made to write basic HTML with &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;body&amp;gt; information in said document, and save it as a .html file.
As you can imagine, I hated the whole idea.
