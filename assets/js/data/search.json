    "content": "or at least writing them down.PreambleOver the last month I’ve invested my time in improving various often-neglectedskills.I was considering two different avenues:  How my relationships impact my day-to-day effectiveness.  Balancing tasks has become more difficult with increased responsibility.The next couple of posts are a summary of interesting resources I’ve adapted to help cope with the growing complexities of adulthood.Starting off with an organisation method: Getting Things Done.It’s well known and simple to understand.I’ve adapted it for my needs and it has served me well over the last couple ofweeks. The jury’s still out on making life easier at this stage, but it’s looking promising for now.The MethodGetting Things Done (GTD) claimstp have 5 steps, but really boils down to 4.   graph TB       A[1. Capture]---B[4. Reflect]    A---C[2. Clarify]    B---D[3. Organise]    C---DCaptureThe essence of Capturing focuses on clearing up your mind from all the tasksthat require balancing.This works if everything is written down, and if this is done frequently.Everything includes almost all random, tiny, suprising tasks that need handlingon a day-to-day basis.The philosophy asks for a notebook carried at all times, to jot down the ideaon the spot.It insists on pen/paper instead of any digital notes if possible.ClarifyThe Clarify step is small but important.It sifts between tasks that can be done under a known time limit Vs. tasks thathave vague completion times for one reason or another.It asks the questions:            1) “Is this task actionable?”      2) “What’s the next action?”      It splits the responses to the questions into further subcategories.  flowchart TD   id1{Actionable?}--&gt;B[No]   id1{Actionable?}--&gt;A[Yes]   B--&gt;C[Incubate]   B--&gt;D[Reference]   B--&gt;E[Trash]   A--&gt;F[Defer]   A--&gt;G[Delegate]   A--&gt;H[Do it]I’ve simplified the diagram and merged some categories to summarise the informationI found important.Let’s explain the terms.First the “No” side.      Incubate: A task that would be nice to be completed but you’re missing information that you are waiting on, or are dependent on other people to continue. Can be postponed for a long time, and even missed.        Reference: This information won’t help complete a task, it’s just usefulto return to in case you might need it later.        Trash: Information you’ve decided you don’t need.You’ve captured it, crossed it out, safely disposed of it.  Now for the “Yes” side.  If it can be accomplished in less than 2 minutes, stop writing it down and do it on the spot.      Delegate: A task that needs to be done but someone else is better suitedto do it. Delegate it, make a new task to follow up on it.        Defer: A task that needs to be completed but you’re missing information that you are waiting on, or are dependent on other people to continue.        Do it: A task that needs to be completed by you, in a timely manner.  OrganiseIn the Organise step the idea is to sort through all the actionable tasks and put them in lists, or tag them to processes.This gives an overview of what needs to be done at a project level overvarious projects, as necessary.Part of organisation includes updating the calendar with any appointments that are required to complete the actions.A reminder section then captures all delegated tasks that require following up.ReflectReflection emphasises that GTD works only if it’s done repeatedly and systematically.Regularly reviewing the lists ensures tasks get completed and information is not lost over time.The philosophy asks that you:  Review of the calendar multiple times a day  Check Actionable lists at least once a day  Do a weekly review of the whole processAdopting the systemAfter a couple of weeks testing the system I’ve modified it to suit my needs better. It’s useful to have the abridged version written up, but I am implementing a compacted version of GTD which I’ve found to speed up the process.This helps me as it’s easy to get lost in following a process rather thangaining value from it.So if the process is as short as possible, it will not distract from its main goal (to get things done).The essentialsThis compact version expects GTD knowleadge to execute as it bundles up information.It boils down the process to what I’ve determined to be the two most useful Diagram Blocks: Incubate, and Actionable.Capturing happens under these two columns over the day/week.A date helps locate which GTD is currently in focus, expecting one to last aweek.A new GTD can be made if tasks changed quickly or the old one needs refactoring.Anything under Incubate includes all the tasks that would be nice to complete, but there’s no time frame, and it’s okay to prolong/extend and even miss.It also includes all references.I don’t bother noting down trash, and anything crossed out I count as trashvisually, so it doesn’t need to be moved/rewritten, even if it’s in theActionable column.Anything under Actionable is a task that needs Defering, Delegationor to be completed.Attempts at writing tasks down should try and maintain the same topic as muchas possible.After all, when focusing on a project, it’s easy to think of all the tasks.It’s much harder to jump around various tasks and write them all down.This can fail as things come up, and as the section grows over the day, butit’s good enough.Clarify and Organise happen in one step under these two columns. To assist organisation, space is left for tags/numbers next to the columns.I usually leave space underneath the page for these columns to expand on whatthe tags mean if necessary.Numbers can be particularly useful to denote priority as well, working double-duty.An example"

    "content": "The drive for a changeGoing into university, I got a new laptop to assist me with my studies.This was 7+ years ago now, and even the mid-life hardware updates I had performed to give it a new life and make it feel fresh again were not cutting it.So after freshly installing Windows on it did not improve its start time, I was once again looking for a new machine after so long.My requirements had changed this time. I no longer needed a laptop powerful enough to handle games.Since I’ve built my desktop, and since streaming games became so easy, I now have all the options I need if I ever want to game away from my desk.I’ve also spent a lot more time in software development and discovered the difficulties in programming on a Windows machine.Therefore, it was time to switch to Linux as a daily driver.So now to pick the specs. I’d still want a powerful laptop, mostly for ease of development.Realistically, another use would be watching videos, so the display had to be nice as well.Discovering FrameworkI learned about Framework and was intrigued by both the modularity and repairability.I had been following laptop trends and was unhappy about the newer anti-consumer practices from Apple, (and likely soon-to-follow laptop brands) with soldered RAM into their newest flagships’ motherboards. Any repair at this point would cost the price of an entire new laptop, and it would be thedefinitely default response provided by Apple. It’s not as profitable, after all, to spend money troubleshooting problems and fixing them.In comparison, Framework felt like a breath of fresh air. New parts to repair the old ones are sold directly by the company for the home user to replace as needed.Laptops are built with that in mind, making repairs easy. I knew there would be compromises, but I decided I was going to evaluate them accordingly.Framework is quite a small company and is still trying to get its feet off the ground.So it only had one device available when I was considering a purchase – the Framework 13.It looked like a good laptop with a couple of generations, decent specs, and even motherboard upgrades.As in, you could buy a new motherboard with an upgraded CPU and only replace that, keeping all other parts, and your data!That still seems amazing to me.However, this laptop is pricey. Niche technology from an up-and-coming company was not going to be competitive in price, and I accepted that.Deciding on the laptopAt the time that I was searching, the Framework 13 was at its matured stage, but the Framework 16 was in its final prototype stages.The cost was very similar as part of pre-ordering and for the latest generation AMD CPU, a 16-inch screen, more hardware extensions, and a possible dedicated GPU upgrade – the decision became clear.Not without its downsides, however, as I placed a pre-order for the FW16 in November, and finally got a shipping notification in May.So the tail end of 2023 was spent with the old laptop, following up on news, and reviews for the batches of laptops getting shipped to reviewers and other pre-order posts on the Framework forums and Reddit.The waiting time definitely gave me cold feet, and honest reviews showcased the difficulties that come with the mass production of new products.People receiving broken, or misaligned components, design deficiencies coming to light, but also, the earnestness of support to provide help to everyone unlucky enough to receive faulty units.I am glad I stuck with it in the end because, despite its faults, I am quite enjoying my new laptop.What I like about itModular portsWith a few restrictions, all the ports to the laptop are based on USB-C, and the laptop comes with slots for modules.These modules are converters between ports, so that one can decide what capabilities their laptop can exhibit.Examples of ports include:  USB-C  USB-A  HDMI  Display Port  Audio Jack  External storage expansion drive  SD-Card  Data for designers to create their own!The laptop comes in two flavours: prebuilt, and DIY. The DIY edition is slightly cheaper, but the user is responsible for assembling all their components, installing the OS and confirming everything works.My favourite part of setting up the DIY edition was reaching out for one of my USB cables and deciding it wouldn’t reach all the way.Instead of rearranging the cabling, I switched the laptop upside-down, unlocked the modules, flipped the USB-A port with the USB-C port, and suddenly the cable could reach! Keyboard customisability I usually like numpads on my laptops.Over the last couple of years though, I’ve started using a laptop without one, but usually attached with an external keyboard while docked, that does have a numpad.So the ability to switch between a centred keyboard/trackpad pair and a left-aligned version with a numpad is wonderful. I’m currently enjoying the numpad configuration, but I’m glad I can switch on the fly. Documentation &amp; Community Setting up the OS was very smooth, a lot of documentation was available both on the Framework website and the forums.I went with Pop-OS in the end. I don’t have the customisability I would like at this point, but because the hardware is so new, the drivers and kinks have not been ironed out yet.So even though I would like to set up Arch eventually, I didn’t want to spend days setting things up only to still have bugs/annoyances every day.Pop-OS is close enough to Ubuntu (which is natively supported) that I successfully got away with installing it hassle-free while still being able to customise it nicely.What I don’t likeSpeakers, Mic, CameraI had already known from the reviews, but the speakers are very weak and muted.If the laptop is not on a hard surface, half of the sound disappears.Headphones are a must if I ever want to watch a video, and I’ve got no solution for watching with multiple people.The camera is a typical laptop camera, not terrible, but very bad with lighting.The microphone is terrible.The sound played back on the speakers probably harms the mic even more, but it sounds choppy, tinny, and crackly.I am not expecting any video calls on the laptop, and if I want to do that, my docking station has a much nicer camera/mic combo.For the price of the laptop, given that these are well-established components that aren’t modular, I was expecting much more emphasis on quality.It is one of the most disappointing parts of the laptop. Precision/Finish of Aesthetics This is their first iteration of the FW16. So it is understandable that there may be some errors.One of the more noticeable ones that also affects my build is the precision of the finish for the non-electronic components.The way the trackpad can be left-aligned is by removing two bezel pieces and rearranging them to both be on the right.These pieces were made precise for their original locations only.I can say this because in their alternate configuration, one sticks out on one side above the metalwork, and the other dips into it on the other side.Hopefully, later iterations of the laptop will fix this, but this is the cost I pay for getting in early.BatteryThe battery life seems weak. 4-5 hours on power saver mode. This is arguably happening for a lot of reasons.  I set the battery max to 80% in the bios to extend my battery’s life.  Pop-OS has its own battery-saving tools, different from AMD’s recommendations.  I’m on balanced mode instead of battery saver a lot of the time.  I’ve heard of other people reducing their power usage by much more, but haven’t found a way to set that up.Even so, a larger battery would be nice. My last laptop’s battery died within a couple of years, so I’ve been wired ever since. It feels like the freedom of wireless computing isn’t going to last long with this device.At least I know I can get a new battery easily.I was also wondering about the impact of the OS on the battery life, and if Windows would have been better than Linux since Linux is notoriously worse in this regard.I am happy with the battery I can get from it now, as having updated to Windows 11 at work and seeing my battery life halve from 6 to 3 hours, confirms that I’ve made the right call even if it’s not the best one.OverallGetting this laptop was a great learning experience, even with all its drawbacks. I still support the idea enough that I’m happy with my purchase and hope that the company develops enough that future purchases will improve on their current lineup."

    "content": "Desire to CodeI wouldn’t claim to have taken a formal programming course and yet I feel confident in being able to come up with programmatic solutions to problems when necessary.This has always felt hacky, and without much direction, I haven’t felt that I could escape this feeling.I’ve considered two ways to address this desire to improve my programming skills.  Learn and practice algorithms – Unknowns remain here.  Branch into a different way of thinking with programming – Functional programming instead of OOP.To learn and practise algorithms I need to pick a language.I’m familiar with Python and C, although neither seems like a good choice.Python is syntactically easy but I’ve never considered it useful beyond scripting.The worry with C is that I’ll be fighting the syntax just as much as the algorithm implementation.Rust carries the same concerns as C, but at least I might get better help with errors.The second task is finding the list of algorithms to implement.There are plenty of resources, I just need to pick one.Pairing this with Advent of Code problems will surely help keep everything refreshed in my mind.Functional ProgrammingAlthough I’ve not had formal OOP training, it’s still the most utilised way to code (at least on the surface of the internet).So whatever I might have learned through the years would have been through an OOP lens.As a change of pace, I wanted to explore functional programming to see what I could learn from the experience.There are great resources for that online for free as well.  OCaml from the very beginning  OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + BeautifulPeculiar titles aside, working through the first book and exercises has been interesting, as I can see the complexity that comes from adopting a recursive thinking style.Once I’ve finished the first book I will look at the second one, which is much more interactive.It will either be as useful or it will supplement knowledge, so it’s more likely that I will skim through it.Halfway through the first book, I began to keep track of the exercises and questions, and they now live on a GitHub repo of mine for posterity.I did look back on the first 5 chapters, and most of the interesting exercises ended up in the utils.ml file, so I haven’t bothered repeating them."

    "content": "Beginning the projectI’ve understood how websites work on the surface level since I was a teenager.At various times, I’ve started HTML documents and got them to display on a browser — simple text and images.But it still annoyed me that I couldn’t see how you’d jump from that to a shop page with reactive windows and custom animations.So after thinking about this from time to time, I finally decided to spend enough time learning how to build a site.The goal was/is a personal repository of past projects and some general information about myself.Starting SimpleAt first, I got interested in CSS.I was inspired by the work of Hyperplexed and tried to recreate some of their suggestions myself.My purpose was to get experience, and to achieve that I had to complete a small CSS task as presented, then try to modify it or add a personal element. More detail on how that went in the post about Playing with CSS.Discovering JekyllI talked to friends and took inspiration from other sites until I stumbled upon 11nty as a simple static site generator.It looked easy to learn, and it boasted performance.So I navigated to GitHub and started looking into hosting one of their GitHub pages.There I discovered that GitHub integrates well with Jekyll, and I would have to adjust many of their instructions to retrofit 11nty where Jekyll lived.So, since I haven’t spent any time in either static site generator, I ended up going with Jekyll.I don’t have the experience to be able to compare the two, although if I ever take up a new project, I might try 11nty so that I can see if I have an easier time getting started.Experimenting with ThemesPart of what attracted me to Jekyll is the available themes.I had spent time in the past making decisions on how I wanted my site to look.This took a lot of time I was willing to reinvest to port into Jekyll.However, GitHub showed that there are existing themes out there, and it was surprisingly easy to find a theme that was close enough to what I wanted to achieve.I ended up with the Chirpy theme and spent some time trying to migrate my existing first draft from the default theme to Chirpy.This led me to discover that Chirpy is using a newer version of Jekyll than GitHub-pages, and therefore the GitHub workflow that exists would not build properly.Although this was discouraging, I tried multiple ways of integrating Chirpy and automating the building and deployment of the site.I ended up with an approach where I would build the assets locally, and have a script to upload them to a separate branch, where the site lived.Even so, the implementation of the Chirpy theme wasn’t all there, and I was having configuration issues.So I bit the bullet, renamed and archived the repository, and started from scratch using the Chirpy template repository.It was a breath of fresh air.Customisation# Hierarchy of organisation for the site generatorJekyll # using Chirpy├── Liquid # Parser to configure Jekyll and the Chirpy theme│   ├── Rouge # CSS Styles configuration?│   └── Ruby # Builds the HTML/SCSS/Js assets└── kramdown # Converts MD documents to HTMLHaving set up the theme, I immediately realised that some of the changes I wanted to perform were non-modifiable unless the theme itself was edited.After I made all the modifications I wanted, I built the site locally instead of deploying it through GitHub.Then I uploaded it to its own branch.Now adding new posts doesn’t rely on anything besides markdown, so this procedure can be automated again.I did need to capture the changes, as updating the Gem theme file from Ruby would wipe them all.Other than that, the only other things I needed to tweak were the _config.yml, contact.yml, and  share.yml files, the names of the tabs, and the data in the assets folder."

    "content": "You can do two things when buying a knock-off product:  Understand that you might be getting something inferior and accept it.You did willingly spend less money, after all. If you don’t want to do that though…  You can turn it into a project — to create a (frankly overcomplicated) mess to cover up the inferiorities of the knock-off item you have purchased.Will the second approach cost more money than the original project?Almost certainly.Will it be a fun teaching experience?It was in this case.So I can at least live with the illusion that I’ve made good decisions for one more day.Smart lights - The ProblemThe smart lights I currently own are not the Philips ones that are more commonly expected when one talks about smart lights.Now there are many off-brand smart lights, and I didn’t spend time comparing differences.I bought what was at a reasonable price at the time, especially with the chip shortage crisis that meant that Philips lights were 2-3x their usual price.I said to myself I’d upgrade once the ones I got burned out.The problem was that these lights did not handle being disconnected from the network gracefully.If they couldn’t find a connection, they would go into their default reconnection mode.That would have been fine if that mode wasn’t to flash the brightest white light once a second.The upshot of this was that the physical light switch became practically useless, and I would have to control my lights exclusively through my phone.This is because the physical light switch cuts the wifi connection from the bulbs and they go into reconnection mode immediately as they come back up instead of looking for the network first.The SolutionThe app to control the lights has a turn-off function.Invoking that would be good enough.I just had to figure out a way to translate the function call from the app, into a physical switch on my wall.It seemed simple enough at the time, and in retrospect it is, just the approach could be more elegant.But this was supposed to be a quick project, so the first (bodgy) solution is the final one, to match the quality of the original product.The Parts  IFTTT - Handles applet requests using WebHooks.  SmartLife API - The app used by the lights manufacturer.  ESP8266 NodeMCU - The (last) microcontroller used for the button control.The PrototypesOf all the items I needed, the only thing I didn’t have in hand was a Wi-Fi module.I already had an Arduino, so I thought I could get a standalone Wi-Fi module for the ESP8266, and that would have been enough to help me implement everything.Having gotten the module, and wiring it up to the Arduino, I realised that I could not get it to make a POST request with an established library.There was an Arduino library that I used to control the Webhooks, but there was nothing that could send the request to the ESP82266 module.Instead, any commands to the module would have to be converted to AT commands.Another thing that came to light was that the combination of the Arduino and the breadboard with the module would make for a clunky and large button interface.What could use my Webhooks code, however, was the ESP8366 NodeMCU which is an MCU with the module installed on it and in a much smaller package as well.The good news was that I could redevelop the code at this point in advance of the MCU appearing after I bought it.Since all the prototyping was almost complete I moved on to veroboard, soldered everything in place to its small form factor and awaited for the NodeMCU to arrive.Version 2 of the system involved unpacking the MCU, plugging it in, and programming it with the code.A brief code snippet with the logic is summarised below, while the whole program can be found on Git Hub.  //Initialise and connect to Wifi  button.setDebounceTime(50);  Serial.begin(115200);  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);  WiFi.disconnect();  delay(1000);  ...  void loop{  button.loop();  if(button.isPressed()){    //Update the button state    //Trigger off or on webhook based on the state    }  }Product ManagementThe hackiest of equipment can look professional if the box is well-designed.I gather more evidence to confirm this claim, the more I investigate electronics by taking them apart.So naturally, to finalise this project I needed a nice box.This was a fun couple of hours in Solidworks, then exporting to STL files and 3D-printing using Ultimaker Cura.First I made the bottom case with slots for the USB cable and holders for the header pins.I managed to make them tight enough that the Veroboard was essentially held in place by the groves and didn’t need any other fixtures.I didn’t quite get the four corners right where the bottom and top case parts would clip onto each other.I had to adjust and print a couple of versions until I was happy with it.The bottom part of the caseThe top part was fairly straightforward and only required two prints to get right.The hole for the button was just too tight by 1mm, so I had to increase the radius to make it less snug.Top part of the caseOutcomeOverall I’m happy with the final box after adding some extra decoration and a command strip to hold it in place.Now so long as the wall plug is on, I can physically press a button for my lights again.I still end up using the app more, but once in a while, it’s just much faster to hit a switch."

    "content": "An introvert’s suggestionOver lunch, we noticed that people started to migrate to different tables randomly without much explanation.Once confronted they said that they didn’t want to be social and didn’t want to explain to people that they were not in a social mood.Even the act of explaining was too uncomfortable some days.So they’d just walk away, but didn’t necessarily want to be away, just left alone that day.I got into watching Great Scott at the time and thought that his intro was a fun thing to try;I just didn’t have anything specific to make into a sign.So I thought, what about a do not disturb sign?You could turn it on at lunch to denote that you didn’t want conversation but still wanted company and people talking to each other around you.I also wanted more control than the Great Scott sign.So I thought, if the NOT lights are a different circuit from the DO and DISTURB words, you could control them independently.Then you could have a DO DISTURB, and a DO NOT DISTURB all at once!So I started with a Veroboard, and bought a packet of 50 LEDs for red and green and arranged them to my design.Arranging the LEDsDesigning the circuitAfter some very quick calculations, I decided the easiest way to power the LEDs was with 2 of them in series using a 5V power supply.So I started trying to add some jumper wires on the Veroboard to wire up the lights and quickly realised that this would not expand well.If I kept iteratively wiring up the circuit, then if there was a point where I was stuck, it would be annoyingly difficult to refactor it.At this point. I stopped designing on the board itself and tried looking for simulation software.I wouldn’t expect much but I did get lucky.VeeCAD does exactly what I wanted for a quick iterative prototype that I could break and rearrange as much as I wanted.It does showcase its age, but it is simple enough which I appreciate.It didn’t evolve to be something more complicated than it needed to be, and it had the amazing feature of mirroring the design before printing.That was great, as it was a challenge to try and design everything mirrored, and now that wasn’t necessary.Care was still needed, but the mirror button was an excellent proof-checker.First attempt at wiring up the signHalfway through the first row, I realised that trying to wire up all the LEDs in pairs would be too cramped.It was at this stage that I switched to 9 Volts for power and 3 LEDs in a row.This change in combination with some clever arrangement and a slightly bigger board, meant I could just squeeze everything in for the final design.Two evenings of work later (for some LEDs!) and I got this design ready to implement.The completed design, expanded a bitCreating it physicallyOnce I was happy with the design, I tried to print it to scale.Doing this in LibreOffice is not a thing I’d recommend.It does have scales in millimetres, and the printer tried its best, but it still took a couple of prints.After that, I started wiring.Here’s a picture partway through the design.Everything was powered by USB-C at the time, but eventually, I switched to a barrel-jack supply.It was certainly simpler than trying to establish the handshake for 9V.Completed the wiring of resistors and links. Only (!) the LEDs were left.Completed design - BacksidePowering it upI was testing the circuit at various points in time via an external power supply and crocodile clips.After I confirmed that all the lights came on as expected and stabilised in all four configurations, I started thinking about switches.The system needed to work in two of the four possible modes (Green ON Red ON, and Green ON Red OFF).If I had two separate power supplies I could have established a three-position switch, but that would not be cost-effective so I had to end up with two switches in the end.Here are pictures of the states the sign can be in now.There is a future where I 3D-print a case for the sign, but as is I like being able to see both sides.My only gripe is that the LEDs I bought in bulk clearly came from different batches even though I hoped they’d be identical.But what can you do, the imperfections are what make it unique."
